Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard – Summary

This dashboard provides an analytical overview of loan performance and customer-level credit risk. It is designed to help understand borrower behavior, identify high-risk segments, and support data-driven credit decisions.

Page 1: Loan Portfolio Overview

This page presents a high-level summary of the loan portfolio.
It includes visual comparisons between default and non-default customers, distribution of loan amounts across credit grades, loan intent patterns, and geographic concentration of lending.
The purpose of this page is to give an overall picture of portfolio health and risk distribution.

Page 2: Risk and Customer Insights

This page focuses on customer-specific risk factors.
It highlights borrower profiles, DTI (debt-to-income) segments, credit tenure patterns, loan grade risk trends, and age distribution.
A detailed risk ranking table helps identify customers with higher repayment risk.
Interactive slicers (gender, marital status, home ownership, employment type, education level) allow users to explore insights across different customer segments.
